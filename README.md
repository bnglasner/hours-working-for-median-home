**Author**: Ben Glasner  
**Last updated**: August 7, 2025

This repository calculates and visualizes how many hours a typical American worker needs to work each month to afford a median-priced home across time, using real hourly wages, home prices, and mortgage rates. It also calculates the one-time burden of saving for a 20% down payment.

## What This Project Does

Given the:
- **Median hourly wage** from CPS Outgoing Rotation Group data
- **Median sales price of a new home** (FRED series `MSPUS`)
- **30-year fixed mortgage rate** (FRED series `MORTGAGE30US`)
- **Inflation adjustment using the PCE price index** (FRED series `PCEPILFE`)

This project calculates:

1. **Monthly hours needed** to afford the monthly mortgage payment  
2. **Total hours needed** to save for a 20% down payment

It visualizes both in an interactive `plotly` chart split across two stacked panels.
